# AlphaGo 

The move that shocked Lee Solel: AlphaGo as a new transductive lineage?

How do we relate to those moves? Why was that move shocking? Could we understand something by tracing the genesis of just that one move, with all its affective resonances, streamed live?

What had the model seen? This was so widely reported


## Todo

- go through nature articles looking for the convolutional layers, and the superimposed knowledges at work here
- look at existing programs and online databases of moves at https://www.gokgs.com/
- compile media database listing
- look at alphago on Github 
- look at deepmind on gh and on website
- connect deepmind to other people ... 
- think about the role of the visual here
- think about how alphago connects to infrastructures
- look at simondon again to see what he'd think about it, especially the way that Fan Hui and the KGS games were used
